# Reaper: External MIDI Instrument (MiniBrute / UltraNova / etc.)

### **Minimal, correct, no-mystery setup**

---

## 1️⃣ Physical connections

**MIDI**

```
Interface MIDI OUT → Synth MIDI IN
```

**Audio**

```
Synth AUDIO OUT → Interface LINE IN
```

(Use DI / isolator if the synth hums.)

---

## 2️⃣ Enable MIDI in Reaper (one-time)

**Options → Preferences → MIDI Devices**

* Enable **MIDI Input** (if using synth keys)
* Enable **MIDI Output** (required)

---

## 3️⃣ Create the MIDI track (notes → synth)

1. **Insert → New Track**
2. Track input:

```
Input: MIDI → [Interface MIDI] → Channel 1
```

3. **Record Arm: ON**
4. **Record Monitoring: ON**
   👉 Speaker icon **grey** and says *“Record monitoring: ON”*
5. Track **Routing (I/O)**:

```
MIDI Hardware Output → [Interface MIDI OUT] → Channel 1
```

🎯 This track **sends MIDI** from items *and* live input.

---

## 4️⃣ Create the audio return track (synth → speakers)

1. **Insert → New Track**
2. Track input:

```
Input: Mono → [Line In X]
```

3. **Record Arm: ON**
4. **Record Monitoring: ON**
5. **Routing (I/O)**:

```
Master/Parent Send → ON
```

🎯 This track **brings the sound back**.

---

## 5️⃣ Playback test

* Put notes in the MIDI item
* Press **Play**
* Synth plays
* Audio meters move
* Sound comes from main outs

If it does → you’re done.

---

# 🔴 GOTCHAS (print this mentally)

### ❗ 1. **Record Monitoring MUST be ON (grey speaker)**

* OFF = MIDI items won’t play hardware
* AUTO = unreliable for external synths
* ON = correct

This is the **#1 Reaper trap**.

---

### ❗ 2. Virtual keyboard ≠ MIDI item playback

* Virtual keyboard working does **not** prove routing is correct
* MIDI items are stricter

---

### ❗ 3. Audio meters ≠ audible sound

You still need:

```
Track → Master → Hardware Out
```

Check:

* Master/Parent Send ON
* Master track routed to interface outputs

---

### ❗ 4. MIDI and audio are **separate tracks**

This is intentional in Reaper.
Use:

* Folder tracks
* Track templates
  to keep things tidy.

---

### ❗ 5. Channel discipline

* MIDI channel on track = synth channel
* Audio track input = correct physical jack

---

### ❗ 6. Monitoring path clarity

While learning:

* **Mute CueMix direct monitoring**
* Monitor through Reaper only
  Avoids “why do I hear it twice / not at all?”

---

## 6️⃣ Optional (but highly recommended)

### Save as a Track Template

* Select MIDI + Audio tracks
* Right-click → **Save tracks as track template**
* Name:
  `External Synth – MIDI + Audio`

Next time:

* Insert template
* Change input numbers
* Done in 10 seconds

---

## One-line mental rule (the big takeaway)

> **In Reaper, external hardware only works when record monitoring is ON.**

Lock that in and Reaper becomes a joy instead of a puzzle.

If you want next, I can:

* Give you a **3-synth template**
* Show how to **print MIDI → audio cleanly**
* Or help you build a **hybrid Ableton/Reaper mental map**

But you’re now fully up and running.
